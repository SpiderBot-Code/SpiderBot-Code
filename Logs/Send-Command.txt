[SpiderGaming]: Hello
[IDoNotExist]: SPIDER YOUR BOT NEEDS A COOLDOWN FOR &ECO WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I CAN SPAM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I HAVE APPROX 70K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[IDoNotExist]: Wait, it's gonna be 80K perhaps.
[IDoNotExist]: You need to fix it, purge <#693463012601888811>, and reset my money.
[IDoNotExist]: That was supposed to be # spammy-spam but you are probably seeing the raw mention syntax thing.
[IDoNotExist]: I have $88721.
[IDoNotExist]: You need to reset mine and purge this channel.
[IDoNotExist]: And make a cooldown, like the one I just had for &send.
