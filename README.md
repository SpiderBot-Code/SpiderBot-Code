# SpiderBot
Spiderbot, Made to do everything, free, forever. (Of course the bot does not do much right now, I'm still developing it)  
SpiderBot brings moderation, leveling, games, and much more!  
The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till It's done.

Original plan: Replace all the bots on my Discord server.  
New plan: Replace all the bots on Discord (just kidding)

This bot is under heavy development and the code is **A little** messy right now.

[Invite the bot to your server]() (not added yet as the bot is not ready for this)

## Run the bot yourself
This is not recommended as you could just add the official bot to your server.  

Install nodejs version `12.0.0` or newer.  
Then navigate to the clones directory in the terminal, run `npm install` to install the needed npm packages.  
Rename the `.example-env` file to `.env` and add your bots token  
Rename the file `database.example.sqlite3` in the config folder to `database.sqlite3`  
To start the bot, run `npm start` or `node index.js`

Figure out how to handle command arguments
