# SpiderBot-Code
Spiderbot, Made to do everything, free, forever. (Of course the bot does nothing right now, I'm developing it)

The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till It's done.

Original plan: Replace all the bots on my Discord server

New plan: Replace all the bots onn Discord (jk, but it helps the slogan ok)

[comment]: <> (Invite the bot to your server)

NOTICE: This bot is being made to be used on multiple servers, an invite link will be provided here soon, once the bot has some actual use. 


This bot is under heavy development and the code is **A little** messy right now.

# Planned Features
- Swear filter
- Fully customizable guild and user config
- Moderation
- Games, including economy
- Leveling roles
- Other fun stuff
- And much more!


## Setup
Make sure you have nodejs `v12.0.0` or newer installed

Navigate to the bots files in the terminal

Run `npm install` to install the needed packages 

Create a file named `.env` and add the bots token after `TOKEN=` (Ex: `TOKEN=Nahwdgaaddawf`)

Rename the file `database.example.sqlite` in the config folder to `database.sqlite`

Run `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the bot.
It will display a message saying the bot has started.

## Bot Usage
The default prefix is `&`
