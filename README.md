# SpiderBot-Code
The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till It's done. The bots main function is to replace all the bots on my server. Or the world hahahahhahah.

[comment]: <> (Invite the bot to your server)

NOTICE: This bot was made to be used on multiple servers, use the invite link here to invite the bot to your server. The code is only here for people who are interested in how it was coded, use for referance, or to report/fix a bug.


# Fetures
- Swear filter
- Fully customizable config
- Moderation
- Economy game
- Leveling roles
- Other fun stuff
- And much more!


## Setup
Make sure you have nodejs `v12.0.0` or newer installed

Navigate to the bots files in the terminal

Run `npm install` to install the needed packages 

Create a file named `.env` and add the bots token after `TOKEN=` (Ex: `TOKEN=Nahwdgaaddawf`)

Run `npm start` or `node SpiderBot.js` to start the bot.
It will display a message saying the bot has started.

## Bot Usage
The default prefix is `&` and can be changed in the `config.json`

The bots commands and their usage can be found here <a href="">documentation</a> (Coming soon)


## Future Plans
* [ ] Use mathjs for the calculation command
* [ ] Make locally hosted web UI for easy configuring
