# SpiderBot-Code
The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till It's done. The bots main function is to replace all the bots on my server.

[comment]: <> (Invite the bot to your server)

NOTICE: This bot is being made to be used on multiple servers, an invite link will be provided here soon, once the bot has some actual use. 


This bot is under heavy development and the code is messy right now. I am learning how to use databases for the bot.

# Features
- Swear filter
- Fully customizable config
- Moderation
- Economy game
- Leveling roles
- Other fun stuff
- And much more!


## Setup
Make sure you have nodejs `v12.0.0` or newer installed

Navigate to the bots files in the terminal

Run `npm install` to install the needed packages 

Create a file named `.env` and add the bots token after `TOKEN=` (Ex: `TOKEN=Nahwdgaaddawf`)

Run `npm start` or `node SpiderBot.js` to start the bot.
It will display a message saying the bot has started.

## Bot Usage
The default prefix is `&`

The bots commands and their usage can be found here <a href="">documentation</a> (Coming soon)
