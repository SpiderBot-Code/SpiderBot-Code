# SpiderBot
Spiderbot, Made to do everything, free, forever.  
SpiderBot brings moderation, leveling, games, and much more!  
~~The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till It's done.~~

Original plan: Replace all the bots on my Discord server.  
New plan: Replace all the bots on Discord (just kidding)

This bot is currently not in development and the code is not functioning.

## Run the bot yourself
This is not recommended as you could just add the official bot to your server.  

Install nodejs version `12.0.0` or newer.  
Then navigate to the clones directory in the terminal, run `npm install` to install the needed npm packages.  
Rename the `.example-env` file to `.env` and add your bots token  
Rename the file `database.example.sqlite3` in the config folder to `database.sqlite3`  
To start the bot, run `npm start` or `node index.js`
