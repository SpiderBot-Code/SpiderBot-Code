# SpiderBot-Code

More to be added soon. The bot is still being worked on, and has a long way to go. A lot of the components of this bot are made specifically for my discord server, however as time goes on i am working to make it more usable.

# Setup
Install the latest version of nodejs
<br>Install discordjs `npm install discord.js`
<br>Run the code by typing `node SpiderBot.js`

# Future Plans
Here are some of the future plans
* [ ] Add moderation commands
* [ ] Add configuration commands
* [ ] Add ranking system, out roles, reaction roles, and possibly a verification role system
* [ ] Add economy game
