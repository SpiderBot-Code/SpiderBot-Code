# SpiderBot-Code
The bot is still being developed, and has a long way till its done. A lot of the components of this bot are made specifically for my [discord server](https://discord.gg/gRMbZyU), however as time goes on I will work on making it more usable usable elsewhere.

Invite the bot to your server! (link coming soon)

# Setup
Install the latest version of nodejs
<br>Install discordjs `npm install discord.js`
<br>Run the code by typing `node SpiderBot.js`

# Future Plans
Here are some of the future plans
* [ ] Add moderation commands
* [ ] Add configuration commands
* [ ] Add ranking system, out roles, reaction roles, and possibly a verification role system
* [ ] Add economy game
